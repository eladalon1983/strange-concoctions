# Screen-capture Community Group charter

## Background

Screen-capture is useful in many contexts, such as when delivering presentations, collaborating with remote colleagues,  or producing local recordings. The Web Platform offers APIs to that end, allowing Web applications to capture screens, windows or tabs, and allowing the captured media to be manipulated in various productive ways.

The popularity of these APIs, and the ubiquity of the applications that use them, are a testament to the importance of the work that has been done thus far.

## Mission

We believe that there is yet more untapped potential in the realm of screen-capture. It is our mission to innovate further and unblock additional novel uses of screen-capture, creating new business opportunities for developers and enriching the lives of users.

## Scope

As part of this charter, the Screen-capture Community Group is focusing its activities on producing new screen-capture APIs and extending existing ones. APIs directly involving screen-capture are in scope, as are APIs that would typically be used in tandem with screen-capture.

## Work mode

The group will conduct all of its technical work in public, on GitHub repositories, with a supporting mailing list for logistical and administrative purposes.

Meetings will initially be public and open to anyone to join. Should the need arise, meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants and guests invited by the group chairs. In either case, a public summary or minutes will be made available publicly.

## Amendments to this charter
The group chairs can propose the group adopt an amended charter, editing the text using the Decision Process described below.

The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by conducting a 30-days vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself, or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such as deliverable dates by the regular group decision process rather than this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision process or rules for amending the charter.
